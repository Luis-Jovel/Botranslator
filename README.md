# Botranslator
This is a chatbot for Facebook Messenger that translates messages from users, featuring English to Spanish translation and vice versa, powered by [Yandex.Translate](https://translate.yandex.com/) API to which an API wrapper was developed for using in the project.

Developed using the **Microsoft Bot Framework** and **Node.js**. It's coded using **Coffee Script** with gulp for task automation. This Chatbot takes advantage of the new Bot Builder V3.1 using Rich cards attachments, dialogs, intent dialogs, Prompts and data validation.
